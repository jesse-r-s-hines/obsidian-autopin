# Archived: Check out [open-tab-settings](https://github.com/jesse-r-s-hines/obsidian-open-tab-settings) instead which provides new-tab behavior without using pins
# Obsidian AutoPin

Automatically pin all tabs by default so don't have to worry about accidentally losing a tab you had open previously. If
you set the "Close tab on unpin" and "Switch to existing tab" settings you create a workflow similar to VSCode and other
 editors.

## Installing

- Install BRAT from the Community Plugins in Obsidian
- Run the command "BRAT: Add a beta plugin for testing"
- Paste in `jesse-r-s-hines/obsidian-autopin`
- Enable "Obsidian AutoPin"
